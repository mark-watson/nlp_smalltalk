== Setup

Copy the files KBSnlp.st and lexicon.txt to the top directory of your Pharo
distribution library. On a Mac, copy them into the App folder that defines
the Pharo application.

Open a File Browser and fileIn the KBSnlp.st source file. Open a Class Browser
and and look at the code in the KBnlp class.

Open a Workspace and one time only evaluate:

== To be done

The enclosed code is a simple Smalltalk port of my Java FastTag part of speech
(POS) tagger that is available on my open source page http://markwatson.com/opensource

When/if I have time I will also port my classifier and named entity recognizer (NER) code.
